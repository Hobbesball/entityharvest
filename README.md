This script is meant to harvest part, or all, of the entities in the Europeana Entity API. 
It linearly iterates over possible entries in the Europeana entity API, so it is predicated on the assumption that entities are added by #id linearly starting from 1 and counting up.
Find documentation for the Entity API here: https://pro.europeana.eu/page/entity
